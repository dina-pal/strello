# SDLC for STRELLO ðŸ§¾ðŸ“²

## 1. Planning
### 1.1. Define the project scope
The first step is to define the scope of the project. This includes identifying the features and functionality that the application will provide to users. In the case of the Trello clone, the scope might include:

- Users can create and manage boards
- Users can create and manage lists within boards
- Users can create and manage cards within lists
- Users can assign labels and due dates to cards
- Users can add comments to cards
- Users can drag and drop cards between lists
- Users can invite other users to collaborate on boards

### 1.2. Create a project plan
Once the project scope has been defined, a plan should be created for how the application will be developed. This might include:

- Creating wireframes and/or mockups of the user interface
- Creating a list of technical requirements for the application
- Defining the development process (e.g. Agile or Waterfall)
- Estimating the time and resources required for development
- Assigning roles and responsibilities to team members
### 1.3. Choose development tools and technologies
The next step is to choose the tools and technologies that will be used to develop the application. For the Trello clone using the **MERN stack**, this might include:

- React for the front-end
- Node.js and Express for the back-end
- MongoDB for the database
- Git for version control
- Visual Studio Code for code editing
## 2. Analysis
### 2.1. Gather requirements
The next step is to gather requirements for the application. This might include:

- Functional requirements (e.g. what the application should do)
- Non-functional requirements (e.g. performance, security, usability)
- User stories or use cases
- Acceptance criteria
### 2.2. Define data models
Based on the requirements gathered, data models should be defined for the application. This might include:

- Board model
- List model
- Card model
- Activity model
- User model
- Label model
- Comment model
### 2.3. Design the user interface
The user interface should be designed based on the requirements gathered. This might include creating wireframes and/or mockups of the application.

## 3. Development
### 3.1. Set up the development environment
Before development can begin, the development environment must be set up. This might include:

- Installing the necessary software and tools (e.g. Node.js, MongoDB, Git, Visual Studio Code)
- Creating a Git repository for version control
- Installing any necessary packages or libraries (e.g. Express, Mongoose, React)
### 3.2. Implement the front-end
Development of the front-end should begin with implementing the user interface. This might include:

- Creating React components for the different parts of the interface (e.g. boards, lists, cards, labels)
- Implementing drag and drop functionality for cards
- Adding form validation for user input
- Styling the user interface using CSS or a CSS preprocessor (e.g. Sass)
### 3.3. Implement the back-end
Once the front-end is in place, development of the back-end can begin. This might include:

- Creating API routes for handling requests from the front-end (e.g. GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- Implementing data models using Mongoose
- Implementing authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Adding error handling and logging
### 3.4. Test the application
Testing should be done throughout the development process to ensure that the application is functioning as expected
